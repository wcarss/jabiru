# Jabiru

Some kind of tilebased game using the creek engine. The randomly generated maps are created by a markov model that was trained on a large 2D map to recognize the frequencies of the occurences of different types of tiles together, and generated using a mechanism commonly referred to as 'wave function collapse'. You can take a look at [wcarss.ca/creek](https://wcarss.ca/creek) if you'd like!
